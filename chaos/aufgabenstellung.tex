\section{Assignment}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Linear oscillating circuit

Measure the amplitude of the fall of tension on a capacitor in dependence of the frequency of a driving sine function. By fitting the data, calculate the resistance, the inductance and the capacitance of the circuit and compare them to their normative values.

\item Nonlinear oscillating circuit 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Measure the amplitude of the fall of tension on a diode in dependence of the frequency of a driving sine function and compare with the linear oscillating circuit.
\item Observe the \emph{Path to Chaos} by changing the amplitude of the driving voltage and generating bifurcations and period doubling. Use different adjustments on the oscillator, i.e. the x-y-plot. Calculate the first terms $a_n$ and $d_n$, which converge against the Feigenbaum-constant $\alpha$ and $\delta$.
\item On the oscilloscope, set up an amplitude-bifurcation-diagram and take a picture of it. Compare it to the bifurcation-diagram of the logistic map.
