\section{Assignment}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Linear oscillating circuit

Measure the amplitude of the fall of tension on a capacitor in dependence of the frequency of a driving sine function. By fitting the data, calculate the resistance, the inductance and de capacitance of the circuit and compare them to the value written on the respective parts.

\item Nonlinear oscillating circuit 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Measure the amplitude of the fall of tension on a diode in dependence of the frequency of a driving sine function and compare with the linear oscillating circuit.
\item Observe the \emph{Path to Chaos} by changing the amplitude of the incoming tension and generating bifurcations and period doubling. Use different adjustments on the oscillator, i.e. the x-y-plot. Calculate the first terms $a_n$ and $d_n$, which converge against the Feigenbaum-constant $\alpha$ and $\delta$.
\item On the oscilloscope, make an amplitude-bifurcation-diagram an make a picture of it. Compare it to the bifurcation-diagram of the logistic map.
